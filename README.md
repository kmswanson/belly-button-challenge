# Module 14 Homework: Belly Button Biodiversity

This module assignment used a combination of javascript, json, and plotly to plot data in three different ways. Extracting the data from the json into the first drop down menu was the first big hurdle, and getting it to reset each time instead of continue to append the data to the #sample-metadata portion of the page. Plotly was quite complicated as well, getting the bar charts and bubble charts to work took a lot longer than I expected them to, and I had to refer back to class recordings to really try and figure out how to get anything going for them. 

I believe that this may have been the most difficult module assignment for me yet, as I'm not sure javascript is really my strongest point. It seems to be the thing in this course I struggle with the most, apart from VBA in the beginning. 

Referenced material to complete this assignment includes the cloud recordings of class lectures, as well as additional provided supplemental content from the instructor.
